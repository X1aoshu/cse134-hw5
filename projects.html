      title="Custom 16-bit Pipelined Processor"
      timeframe="03/2025 – 06/2025 · UC San Diego"
      desc="Designed a five stage pipelined 16 bit CPU from the ISA up, including datapath, ALU, control logic, hazard detection, and forwarding. Implemented the design in SystemVerilog, wrote directed and random tests, and deployed to an FPGA board to run benchmark programs such as matrix multiply and Fibonacci in hardware. Focused on balancing clock frequency, resource usage, and clarity of the microarchitecture."

      desc="Led a six person team to design and prototype a mobile application from zero, using agile iterations, sprint planning, and retrospectives. Applied behaviour driven development and design by contract to keep requirements, test cases, and implementation aligned. Set up CI and basic automated checks so that every pull request was validated before merging, which helped the team deliver an on time and stable MVP."
